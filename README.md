# Mastermind

## What's Mastermind?

[Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) is a board game for code breakers.

## Why Mastermind?

The rules of Mastermind are straightforward and easy to master, but finding the optimal sequence of guesses to eliminate the thousands of possibilities and discover the secret code will test your critical thinking ability.

Mastermind has been a popular topic for Mathematicians and Computer Scientists in areas of algorithm design and complexity theory. Most famously, in a 1977 [paper](http://www.cs.uni.edu/~wallingf/teaching/cs3530/resources/knuth-mastermind.pdf), [Donald Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth) produced an algorithm to solve the problem in five moves or fewer.

Mastermind therefore not only provides an interesting opportunity for game or UI developers, but for software developers looking to integrate Artifical Intelligence with application development in general.

## How Can I Play?

The latest version is available [here](https://bvelt.github.io/mastermind/). For instructions on how to run locally, see [ui/mm-react/README](ui/mm-react/README.md).

## What's Next?

I plan to produce several versions using several front-end frameworks. The current version is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/). Next, I plan to develop a native mobile version using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). 

As as exploration of how to integrate artificial intelligence in general applications, I also plan to develop an __assist__ mode that will provide interactive guidance to the codebreaker as the game is played. The goal is to teach the codebreaker optimal strategies and to suggest better moves.
